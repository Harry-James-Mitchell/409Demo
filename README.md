# 409Demo

This is a prototype I developed during the fall of 2018 for a presentation for my system requirements class.
It is a simple Unity game showcasing the basic ideas for a game my group was theoretically going to develop.
You can move the character around by using WASD for movement and you can move the mouse around to control the camera.
You can also move the character around using an XBOX controller by manipulating the left joystick.
The goal of all of the levels is to find and pick up 5 piles of gold coins and then return the astronaut to the ship.
